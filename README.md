# E.T. Chickens

Developed during the 2013 NASA Space Apps Challenge, this is an HTML5 based Android app for poultry farmers who either new to the experience and/or are looking for a way to track their chickens.

## Features

- localStorage capabilities
- HTML5 standards compliant

## Getting it to run

Got to assets > www  and you will find a directory structure very similar to something you would see in a typical web deployment. If you open the index.html file in a browser you will see the app.

## What's it made of?

Simple vanilla JS from bananastand.js. CSS provided through SASS compilation. The XML and other files should already be set. (If you want to change 'etchickens' to your project name it might cause a few problems, it did for us).
